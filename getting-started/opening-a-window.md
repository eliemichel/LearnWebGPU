```

*Resulting code:* [`step020`](https://github.com/eliemichel/LearnWebGPU-Code/tree/step020)

Before being able to render anything on screen, we need to ask the Operating System (OS) to hand us a place on which to draw things, something commonly known as a **window**.

The process to open a window **depends a lot on the OS**, so we use a little library called [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) which unifies the different window management APIs and enables our code to be **agnostic** to the OS.

```{note}
I try to use as few libraries as I can, but this one is required to **make our code cross-platform**, which feels even more important to me than writing code from scratch. GLFW is furthermore **a very common choice** and quite small in its design.
```

```{admonition} Headless mode
WebGPU **does not actually require a window** to draw things, it may run headless and draw to **offscreen textures**. Since this is not a use case as common as drawing in a window, I leave the details of this option to [a dedicated chapter](../advanced-techniques/headless.md) of the advanced section.
```

```{admonition} SDL
**Another popular choice** for window management is the **SDL library**. It is not as lightweight as GLFW but provides more features, like support for sound and Android/iOS targets. [A dedicated appendix](../appendices/using-sdl.md) shows what to change to the main guide when using SDL.
```

Integration of GLFW
-------------------

We do **not really need to install** it, we just need to add the code of GLFW to our project directory. Download the file [glfw.zip](../data/glfw-3.4.0-light.zip) (780 KB) and **unzip** it in your project. This is a stripped down version of the official release where I removed documentation, examples and tests so that it is more **lightweight**.

To **integrate GLFW** in our project, we add its directory to our root `CMakeLists.txt` with `add_subdirectory(glfw)`. We add an **exception for emscripten** because it has **built-in** support for GLFW; all we need in that case is to set the `-sUSE_GLFW=3` link option.

```{lit} CMake, Dependency subdirectories (prepend)
if (NOT EMSCRIPTEN)
	# Add the 'glfw' directory, which contains the definition of a 'glfw' target
	add_subdirectory(glfw)
else()
	# Create a mock 'glfw' target that just sets the `-sUSE_GLFW=3` link option:
	add_library(glfw INTERFACE)
	target_link_options(glfw INTERFACE -sUSE_GLFW=3)
endif()
# In both cases, we can now link to the 'glfw' target
```

```{note}
When using **Dawn**, make sure to add the `glfw` directory **before** you add `webgpu`, otherwise Dawn provides its own version (which may be fine sometimes, but you don't get to chose the version).
```

Then, we must tell CMake to **link our application to this library**, like we did for webgpu:

```{lit} CMake, Link libraries (replace)
# Add the 'glfw' target as a dependency of our App
target_link_libraries(App PRIVATE webgpu glfw)
```

You should now be able to build the application and add `#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>` at the beginning of the main file.

```{lit} C++, Includes (append)
#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>
```

````{important}
If you are on a **linux** system, make sure to install the [dependencies that GLFW require](https://www.glfw.org/docs/3.3/compile.html#compile_deps). By default, it tries to build for both **X11** and **Wayland** so you need both sets of dependencies. If you only want to use/install one of them, turn either `GLFW_BUILD_X11` or `GLFW_BUILD_WAYLAND` off when calling cmake, e.g.:

```
# Build with only X11 support
cmake -B build -DGLFW_BUILD_WAYLAND=OFF
```
````

Basic usage
-----------

In this section we get familiar with GLFW, without any WebGPU-specific consideration.

### Initialization

First of all, any call to the GLFW library must be between its initialization and termination:

```{lit} C++, Main Content
glfwInit();
{{Use GLFW}}
glfwTerminate();
```

The init function returns **false** when it could not setup things up:

```{lit} C++, Use GLFW
if (!glfwInit()) {
	std::cerr << "Could not initialize GLFW!" << std::endl;
	return 1;
}
{{Create and destroy window (hidden)}}
```

Once the library has been initialized, we may **create a window**:

```{lit} C++, Create and destroy window
// Create the window
GLFWwindow* window = glfwCreateWindow(640, 480, "Learn WebGPU", nullptr, nullptr);

{{Use the window}}

// At the end of the program, destroy the window
glfwDestroyWindow(window);
```

Here again, we may add some **error management**:

```{lit} C++, Use the window
if (!window) {
	std::cerr << "Could not open window!" << std::endl;
	glfwTerminate();
	return 1;
}
```

### Window hints

The `glfwCreateWindow` function has some optional **extra arguments** that are passed through calls of `glfwWindowHint` **before** invoking `glfwCreateWindow`. We add two hints in our case:

 - Setting `GLFW_CLIENT_API` to `GLFW_NO_API` tells GLFW **not to care about the graphics API**, as it does not know WebGPU and we won't use what it could set up by default for other APIs.
 - Setting `GLFW_RESIZABLE` to `GLFW_FALSE` prevents the user from **resizing the window**. We will release this constraint later on, but for now it avoids some inconvenient crashes.

```{lit} C++, Create window
glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CLIENT_API, GLFW_NO_API); // <-- extra info for glfwCreateWindow
glfwWindowHint(GLFW_RESIZABLE, GLFW_FALSE);
GLFWwindow* window = glfwCreateWindow(640, 480, "Learn WebGPU", nullptr, nullptr);
```

```{tip}
I invite you to look at the documentation of GLFW to learn more about [`glfwCreateWindow`](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/group__window.html#ga3555a418df92ad53f917597fe2f64aeb) and other related functions.
```

### Main loop

At this point, the window opens and **closes immediately** afterward. To address this, we add the application's **main loop** just before all the release/destroy/terminate calls:

```{lit} C++, Main loop
while (!glfwWindowShouldClose(window)) {
	// Check whether the user clicked on the close button (and any other
	// mouse/key event, which we don't use so far)
	glfwPollEvents();
}
```

```{note}
This main loop is where most of the application's logic occurs. We will repeatedly clear and redraw the whole image, and check for new user input.
```

```{figure} /images/glfw-boilerplate.png
:align: center
:class: with-shadow
Our first window, using the GLFW library.
```

```{warning}
This main loop will **not work** with **Emscripten**. In a Web page, the main loop is handled by the browser and we just tell it **what to call at each frame**. We **fix this** below while refactoring our program around an `Application` class.
```

Application class
-----------------

### Refactor

Let us **reorganize our project a bit** so that it is more Web-friendly and clearer about the **initialization** versus **main loop** separation.

We create functions `Initialize()`, `MainLoop()` and `Terminate()` to split up the three key parts of our program. We also put **all the variables** that these functions share in a common class/struct, that we call for instance `Application`. For better readability, we may have `Initialize()`, `MainLoop()` and `Terminate()` be members of this class:

```{lit} C++, Application class
class Application {
public:
	// Initialize everything and return true if it went all right
	bool Initialize();

	// Uninitialize everything that was initialized
	void Terminate();

	// Draw a frame and handle events
	void MainLoop();

	// Return true as long as the main loop should keep on running
	bool IsRunning();

private:
	// All the variables that are shared between init and main loop are placed here
	{{Application attributes}}
};
```

```{lit} C++, file: main.cpp (replace, hidden)
{{Includes}}

{{Application class}}

{{Main function}}

{{Application implementation}}
```

Our main function becomes as simple as this:

```{lit} C++, Main function
int main() {
	Application app;

	if (!app.Initialize()) {
		return 1;
	}

	// Warning: this is still not Emscripten-friendly, see below
	while (app.IsRunning()) {
		app.MainLoop();
	}

	app.Terminate();

	return 0;
}
```

And we can now move almost all our current code to `Initialize()`. The only thing that belongs to `MainLoop()` for now is the polling of GLFW events and WebGPU device:

```{lit} C++, Application implementation
bool Application::Initialize() {
	// Move the whole initialization here
	{{Initialize}}
	return true;
}

void Application::Terminate() {
	// Move all the release/destroy/terminate calls here
	{{Terminate}}
}

void Application::MainLoop() {
	glfwPollEvents();

	{{Main loop content}}

	// Also move here the tick/poll but NOT the emscripten sleep
	{{Poll WebGPU Events}}
}

bool Application::IsRunning() {
	return !glfwWindowShouldClose(window);
}
```

```{lit} C++, Poll WebGPU Events (hidden)
#if defined(WEBGPU_BACKEND_DAWN)
	wgpuDeviceTick(device);
#elif defined(WEBGPU_BACKEND_WGPU)
	wgpuDevicePoll(device, false, nullptr);
#endif
```

```{lit} C++, Main loop content (hidden)
```

```{lit} C++, Initialize (hidden)
{{Open window and get adapter}}

{{Request device}}

// We no longer need to access the adapter
wgpuAdapterRelease(adapter);

{{Add device error callback}}

queue = wgpuDeviceGetQueue(device);
```

```{lit} C++, Open window and get adapter (hidden)
// Open window
glfwInit();
glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CLIENT_API, GLFW_NO_API); // <-- extra info for glfwCreateWindow
glfwWindowHint(GLFW_RESIZABLE, GLFW_FALSE);
window = glfwCreateWindow(640, 480, "Learn WebGPU", nullptr, nullptr);

// Create instance
WGPUInstance instance = wgpuCreateInstance(nullptr);

// Get adapter
std::cout << "Requesting adapter..." << std::endl;
{{Request adapter}}
std::cout << "Got adapter: " << adapter << std::endl;

// We no longer need to access the instance
wgpuInstanceRelease(instance);
```

```{lit} C++, Add device error callback (hidden)
// Device error callback
auto onDeviceError = [](WGPUErrorType type, char const* message, void* /* pUserData */) {
	std::cout << "Uncaptured device error: type " << type;
	if (message) std::cout << " (" << message << ")";
	std::cout << std::endl;
};
wgpuDeviceSetUncapturedErrorCallback(device, onDeviceError, nullptr /* pUserData */);
```

```{lit} C++, Request device (hidden)
// Get device
std::cout << "Requesting device..." << std::endl;
WGPUDeviceDescriptor deviceDesc = {};
deviceDesc.nextInChain = nullptr;
{{Build device descriptor}}
device = requestDeviceSync(adapter, &deviceDesc);
std::cout << "Got device: " << device << std::endl;
```

```{lit} C++, Build device descriptor (hidden)
deviceDesc.label = "My Device"; // anything works here, that's your call
deviceDesc.requiredFeatureCount = 0; // we do not require any specific feature
deviceDesc.requiredLimits = nullptr; // we do not require any specific limit
deviceDesc.defaultQueue.nextInChain = nullptr;
deviceDesc.defaultQueue.label = "The default queue";
// A function that is invoked whenever the device stops being available.
deviceDesc.deviceLostCallback = [](WGPUDeviceLostReason reason, char const* message, void* /* pUserData */) {
	std::cout << "Device lost: reason " << reason;
	if (message) std::cout << " (" << message << ")";
	std::cout << std::endl;
};
```

```{lit} C++, Terminate (hidden)
wgpuQueueRelease(queue);
{{Destroy surface}}
wgpuDeviceRelease(device);
glfwDestroyWindow(window);
glfwTerminate();
```

```{important}
**Do not** move the `emscripten_sleep(100)` line to `MainLoop()`. This line is no longer needed once we **let the browser handle** the main loop, because the browser ticks its WebGPU backend itself.
```

Once you have moved everything, you should end up with the following class attributes shared across init/main:

```{lit} C++, Application attributes
GLFWwindow *window;
WGPUDevice device;
WGPUQueue queue;
```

```{note}
The `WGPUInstance` and `WGPUAdapter` are intermediate steps towards getting the device that may be released in the initialization.
```

### Emscripten

As mentioned multiple times above, explicitly writing the `while` loop is not possible when building for the **Web** (with Emscripten) because it **conflicts** with the web browser's own loop. We thus write the main loop differently in such a case:

```{lit} C++, Main loop (replace)
#ifdef __EMSCRIPTEN__
	{{Emscripten main loop}}
#else // __EMSCRIPTEN__
	while (app.IsRunning()) {
		app.MainLoop();
	}
#endif // __EMSCRIPTEN__
```

```{lit} C++, Main function (replace, hidden)
int main() {
	Application app;

	if (!app.Initialize()) {
		return 1;
	}

	{{Main loop}}

	app.Terminate();

	return 0;
}
```

Here we use the function [`emscripten_set_main_loop_arg()`](https://emscripten.org/docs/api_reference/emscripten.h.html#c.emscripten_set_main_loop_arg), which is precisely **dedicated to this issue**. This sets a **callback** that the browser will call each time it runs its main rendering loop.

```C++
// Callback type takes one argument of type 'void*' and returns nothing
typedef void (*em_arg_callback_func)(void*);

// Signature of 'emscripten_set_main_loop_arg' as provided in emscripten.h
void emscripten_set_main_loop_arg(
	em_arg_callback_func func,
	void *arg,
	int fps,
	int simulate_infinite_loop
)
```

Notice the **callback pattern** that we used already when requesting the adapter and device, or setting error callbacks. What is called `arg` here is what WebGPU calls `userdata`: it is a pointer that is **blindly passed to the callback** function.

```{lit} C++, Emscripten main loop
// Equivalent of the main loop when using Emscripten:
auto callback = [](void *arg) {
    //                   ^^^ 2. We get the address of the app in the callback.
    Application* pApp = reinterpret_cast<Application*>(arg);
    //                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 3. We force this address to be interpreted
    //                                      as a pointer to an Application object.
    pApp->MainLoop(); // 4. We can use the application object
};
emscripten_set_main_loop_arg(callback, &app, 0, true);
//                                     ^^^^ 1. We pass the address of our application object.
```

The extra arguments are recommended to be `0` and `true`:

 - `fps` is the **framerate** at which the function gets called. For **better performance**, it is recommended to set it to 0 to leave it up to the browser (equivalent of using `requestAnimationFrame` in JavaScript)
 - `simulate_infinite_loop` must be `true` to prevent `app` from being freed. Otherwise, the `main` function **returns before the callback gets invoked**, so the application no longer exists and the `arg` pointer is *dangling* (i.e., points to nothing valid).

The Surface
-----------

It is now time to **connect our GLFW window to WebGPU**. This happens when **requesting the adapter**, by specifying a **WGPUSurface** object to draw on:

```{lit} C++, Request adapter (replace)
{{Get the surface}}

WGPURequestAdapterOptions adapterOpts = {};
adapterOpts.nextInChain = nullptr;
adapterOpts.compatibleSurface = surface;
//                              ^^^^^^^ Use the surface here

WGPUAdapter adapter = requestAdapterSync(instance, &adapterOpts);
```

**How do we get the surface?** This depends on the OS, and GLFW does not handle this for us, since it does not know about WebGPU ([yet?](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/pull/2333)). So I provide you this function, in a little extension to GLFW3 called [`glfw3webgpu`](https://github.com/eliemichel/glfw3webgpu).

### GLFW3 WebGPU Extension

Download and unzip [glfw3webgpu.zip](https://github.com/eliemichel/glfw3webgpu/releases/download/v1.2.0/glfw3webgpu-v1.2.0.zip) in your project's directory. There should now be a directory `glfw3webgpu` sitting next to your `main.cpp`. Like we have done before, we can add this directory and link the target it creates to our App:

```{lit} CMake, glfw3webgpu subdirectory (insert in {{Dependency subdirectories}} after "add_subdirectory(webgpu)")
add_subdirectory(glfw3webgpu)
```

```{lit} CMake, Link libraries (replace)
target_link_libraries(App PRIVATE glfw webgpu glfw3webgpu)
target_copy_webgpu_binaries(App)
```

```{note}
The `glfw3webgpu` library is **very simple**, it is only made of 2 files so we could have almost included them directly in our project's source tree. However, it requires some special compilation flags in macOS that we would have had to deal with (you can see them in the `CMakeLists.txt`).
```

You can now get the surface by simply doing:

```{lit} C++, Includes (append)
#include <glfw3webgpu.h>
```

```{lit} C++, Get the surface
surface = glfwGetWGPUSurface(instance, window);
```

Also don't forget to release the surface at the end:

```{lit} C++, Destroy surface
wgpuSurfaceRelease(surface);
```

````{important}
The **surface** lives independently from the adapter and device, so it **must not** be released **before the end** of the program like we do for the adapter and instance. It is thus defined as a class attribute of `Application`:

```{lit} C++, Application attributes (append)
WGPUSurface surface;
```
````

Conclusion
----------

In this chapter we set up the following:

 - Use the [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) library to handle **windowing** (as well as user input, see later).
 - Refactor our code to separate **initialization** from **main loop**.
 - **Connect WebGPU** to our window using the [glfw3webgpu](https://github.com/eliemichel/glfw3webgpu) extension.

We are now ready to **display something** on this window!
