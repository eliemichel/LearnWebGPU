In its overall outline, **drawing a triangle** is as simple as this:

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Draw a triangle
// Select which render pipeline to use
renderPass.setPipeline(pipeline);
// Draw 1 instance of a 3-vertices shape
renderPass.draw(3, 1, 0, 0);
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Draw a triangle (for tangle root "Vanilla")
// Select which render pipeline to use
wgpuRenderPassEncoderSetPipeline(renderPass, pipeline);
// Draw 1 instance of a 3-vertices shape
wgpuRenderPassEncoderDraw(renderPass, 3, 1, 0, 0);
```
````

What is a bit verbose is the configuration of the **render pipeline**, and the creation of **shaders**.

Render Pipeline
---------------

In order to achieve high performance real-time 3D rendering, the GPU processes shapes through a predefined pipeline. The pipeline itself is **always the same** (it is generally built into the physical architecture of the hardware), but we can **configure** it in many ways. To do so, WebGPU provides a *Render Pipeline* object.

```{note}
If you are familiar with OpenGL, you can see WebGPU's render pipeline as a memorized value for all the stateful functions that configure the rendering pipeline.
```

The figure below illustrates the sequence of data processing **stages** executed by the render pipeline. Most of them are **fixed-function** stages, meaning we can only customize some variables, but the most powerful ones are the **programmable stages**.

In these programmable stages, a true program, called a **shader**, is executed in a massively parallel way (across input **vertices**, or across rasterized **fragments**).

```{image} /images/render-pipeline-light.svg
:align: center
:class: only-light
```

```{image} /images/render-pipeline-dark.svg
:align: center
:class: only-dark
```

<p class="align-center">
    <span class="caption-text"><em>The Render Pipeline abstraction used by WebGPU, detailed in subsections below.</em></span>
</p>

```{note}
Other graphics APIs provide access to more programmable stages (geometry shader, mesh shader, task shader). These are not part of the Web standard. They might be available in the future as native-only extensions, but in a lot of cases one can use general purpose [compute shaders](../basic-compute/index.md) to mimic their behavior.
```

As always, we build a descriptor in order to create the render pipeline:

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Create Render Pipeline
RenderPipelineDescriptor pipelineDesc;
{{Describe render pipeline}}
RenderPipeline pipeline = device.createRenderPipeline(pipelineDesc);
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Create Render Pipeline (for tangle root "Vanilla")
WGPURenderPipelineDescriptor pipelineDesc{};
pipelineDesc.nextInChain = nullptr;
{{Describe render pipeline}}
WGPURenderPipeline pipeline = wgpuDeviceCreateRenderPipeline(device, &pipelineDesc);
```
````

We now detail the configuration of the **different stages**. We start with a very **minimal setup** where we leave a lot of features unused, they will be introduced progressively in the next chapters.

**Pipeline description** consists in the following steps, **following the order of the figure above**:

```{lit} C++, Describe render pipeline (also for tangle root "Vanilla")
{{Describe vertex pipeline state}}
{{Describe primitive pipeline state}}
{{Describe fragment pipeline state}}
{{Describe stencil/depth pipeline state}}
{{Describe multi-sampling state}}
{{Describe pipeline layout}}
```

### Vertex pipeline state

Both the **vertex fetch** and **vertex shader** stages are configured through the **vertex state** structure, accessible at `pipelineDesc.vertex`.

```{lit} C++, Describe vertex pipeline state (also for tangle root "Vanilla")
// Configure 'pipelineDesc.vertex'
{{Describe vertex buffers}}
{{Describe vertex shader}}
```

The render pipeline first **fetches vertex attributes** from some buffers that lives in GPU memory. These *attributes* include usually at least a **vertex position**, and might include additional per-vertex information like **color**, **normal**, **texture coordinate**, etc.

**In this first example**, we hard-code the position of the 3 vertices of the triangles in shaders so we do not even need a position buffer.

```{lit} C++, Describe vertex buffers (also for tangle root "Vanilla")
// We do not use any vertex buffer for this first simplistic example
pipelineDesc.vertex.bufferCount = 0;
pipelineDesc.vertex.buffers = nullptr;
```

Then each vertex is processed by a custom **vertex shader**. A shader is the combination of:

 1. A **shader module**, which contains the actual code of the shader.
 2. An **entry point**, which is the name of the function in the shader module that must be called for each vertex. This enables a given shader module to include entry points for multiple render pipeline configurations at the same time. In particular, we use the same module for the vertex and fragment shaders.
 3. An array of value assignments for the **constants** of the shader. We do not use any for now.

```{lit} C++, Describe vertex shader (also for tangle root "Vanilla")
// NB: We define the 'shaderModule' in the second part of this chapter.
// Here we tell that the programmable vertex shader stage is described
// by the function called 'vs_main' in that module.
pipelineDesc.vertex.module = shaderModule;
pipelineDesc.vertex.entryPoint = "vs_main";
pipelineDesc.vertex.constantCount = 0;
pipelineDesc.vertex.constants = nullptr;
```

The `shaderModule` will be defined in [the next section](#shaders).

### Primitive pipeline state

The **primitive state** structure found at `pipelineDesc.primitive` configures the **primitive assembly** and **rasterization** stages.

The **rasterization** is the very heart ‚ù§Ô∏è of the 3D rendering algorithm implemented by a GPU. It transforms a **primitive** (a point, a line or a triangle) into a series of **fragments**, that correspond to the pixels covered by the primitive. It **interpolates** any extra attribute output by the vertex shader, such that each fragment receives a value for all attributes.

The **primitive assembly** configuration consists in stating how the array of vertices fetched earlier must be **connected** to for either a point cloud, a wire frame or a triangle soup. We set it to its default configuration:

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Describe primitive pipeline state
// Each sequence of 3 vertices is considered as a triangle
pipelineDesc.primitive.topology = PrimitiveTopology::TriangleList;

// We'll see later how to specify the order in which vertices should be
// connected. When not specified, vertices are considered sequentially.
pipelineDesc.primitive.stripIndexFormat = IndexFormat::Undefined;

// The face orientation is defined by assuming that when looking
// from the front of the face, its corner vertices are enumerated
// in the counter-clockwise (CCW) order.
pipelineDesc.primitive.frontFace = FrontFace::CCW;

// But the face orientation does not matter much because we do not
// cull (i.e. "hide") the faces pointing away from us (which is often
// used for optimization).
pipelineDesc.primitive.cullMode = CullMode::None;
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Describe primitive pipeline state (for tangle root "Vanilla")
// Each sequence of 3 vertices is considered as a triangle
pipelineDesc.primitive.topology = WGPUPrimitiveTopology_TriangleList;

// We'll see later how to specify the order in which vertices should be
// connected. When not specified, vertices are considered sequentially.
pipelineDesc.primitive.stripIndexFormat = WGPUIndexFormat_Undefined;

// The face orientation is defined by assuming that when looking
// from the front of the face, its corner vertices are enumerated
// in the counter-clockwise (CCW) order.
pipelineDesc.primitive.frontFace = WGPUFrontFace_CCW;

// But the face orientation does not matter much because we do not
// cull (i.e. "hide") the faces pointing away from us (which is often
// used for optimization).
pipelineDesc.primitive.cullMode = WGPUCullMode_None;
```
````

```{note}
Usually we set the **cull mode** to `Front` to avoid wasting resources in rendering the inside of objects. But for beginners it **can be very frustrating** to see nothing on screen for hours only to discover that the triangle was just facing in the wrong direction, so I advise you to set it to `None` when **developing**.
```

### Fragment shader

Once a primitive have been sliced into many little fragments by the rasterizer, the **fragment shader** stage is invoked for each one of them. This shader receives the interpolated values generated by the vertex shader, and must output on its turn the **final color** of the fragment.

```{note}
Keep in mind that all these stages are happening in a **very parallel** and **asynchronous** environment. When rendering a large mesh, the fragment shader for the first primitives may be invoked before the last primitives have been rasterized.
```

The configuration is very similar to the configuration of the vertex shader:

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Describe fragment pipeline state
// We tell that the programmable fragment shader stage is described
// by the function called 'fs_main' in the shader module.
FragmentState fragmentState;
fragmentState.module = shaderModule;
fragmentState.entryPoint = "fs_main";
fragmentState.constantCount = 0;
fragmentState.constants = nullptr;
{{We'll configure the blending stage here}}
pipelineDesc.fragment = &fragmentState;
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Describe fragment pipeline state (for tangle root "Vanilla")
// We tell that the programmable fragment shader stage is described
// by the function called 'fs_main' in the shader module.
WGPUFragmentState fragmentState{};
fragmentState.module = shaderModule;
fragmentState.entryPoint = "fs_main";
fragmentState.constantCount = 0;
fragmentState.constants = nullptr;
{{We'll configure the blending stage here}}
pipelineDesc.fragment = &fragmentState;
```
````

Note that the fragment stage is **optional**, so `pipelineDesc.fragment` is a (potentially null) pointer instead of directly holding the fragment state structure.

### Stencil/Depth state

The **depth test** is used to discard fragments that are **behind** other fragments associated to the *same pixel*. Remember that a fragment is the projection of a given primitive on a given pixel, so **when primitives overlap each others**, multiple fragments are emitted for the same pixel. Fragments have a **depth** information, which is used by the depth test.

The **stencil test** is another fragment discarding mechanism, used to hide fragments based on previously rendered primitives. Let's **ignore** the depth and stencil mechanism **for now**, we will introduce them in the [Depth buffer](3d-meshes/depth-buffer.md) chapter.

```{lit} C++, Describe stencil/depth pipeline state (also for tangle root "Vanilla")
// We do not use stencil/depth testing for now
pipelineDesc.depthStencil = nullptr;
```

### Blending

The blending stage takes each fragment's color and "paints" it onto the target color attachment. If the original color in the **destination** pixel is $(r_d, g_d, b_d, a_d)$ and the color of the **source** fragment to paint is $(r_s, g_s, b_s, a_s)$, what should be the final color $(r, g, b, a)$ of the final pixel? This is what the **blend state** specifies.

We must also specify what **format** (i.e., how to represent the values as zeros and ones) the colors are expected to be stored in the final attachment.

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, We'll configure the blending stage here
BlendState blendState;
{{Configure color blending equation}}
{{Configure alpha blending equation}}

ColorTargetState colorTarget;
colorTarget.format = surfaceFormat;
colorTarget.blend = &blendState;
colorTarget.writeMask = ColorWriteMask::All; // We could write to only some of the color channels.

// We have only one target because our render pass has only one output color
// attachment.
fragmentState.targetCount = 1;
fragmentState.targets = &colorTarget;
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, We'll configure the blending stage here (for tangle root "Vanilla")
WGPUBlendState blendState{};
{{Configure color blending equation}}
{{Configure alpha blending equation}}

WGPUColorTargetState colorTarget{};
colorTarget.format = surfaceFormat;
colorTarget.blend = &blendState;
colorTarget.writeMask = WGPUColorWriteMask_All; // We could write to only some of the color channels.

// We have only one target because our render pass has only one output color
// attachment.
fragmentState.targetCount = 1;
fragmentState.targets = &colorTarget;
```
````

The **blending equation** can be set independently for the rgb channels and the alpha channel, in general, it takes the following form:

$$
rgb = \texttt{srcFactor} \times rgb_s ~~[\texttt{operation}]~~ \texttt{dstFactor} \times rgb_d
$$

The **usual blending** equation is configured as $rgb = a_s \times rgb_s + (1 - a_s) \times rgb_d$. This corresponds to **the intuition of layering** the rendered fragments over the existing pixels value:

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Configure color blending equation
blendState.color.srcFactor = BlendFactor::SrcAlpha;
blendState.color.dstFactor = BlendFactor::OneMinusSrcAlpha;
blendState.color.operation = BlendOperation::Add;
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Configure color blending equation (for tangle root "Vanilla")
blendState.color.srcFactor = WGPUBlendFactor_SrcAlpha;
blendState.color.dstFactor = WGPUBlendFactor_OneMinusSrcAlpha;
blendState.color.operation = WGPUBlendOperation_Add;
```
````

And there is a similar blending equation for the alpha channel:

$$
a = \texttt{srcFactor} \times a_s ~~[\texttt{operation}]~~ \texttt{dstFactor} \times a_d
$$

For instance we can leave the target alpha untouched: $a = a_d = 0 \times a_s + 1 \times a_d$

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Configure alpha blending equation
blendState.alpha.srcFactor = BlendFactor::Zero;
blendState.alpha.dstFactor = BlendFactor::One;
blendState.alpha.operation = BlendOperation::Add;
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Configure alpha blending equation (for tangle root "Vanilla")
blendState.alpha.srcFactor = WGPUBlendFactor_Zero;
blendState.alpha.dstFactor = WGPUBlendFactor_One;
blendState.alpha.operation = WGPUBlendOperation_Add;
```
````

### Multi-sampling

I said previously that a fragment is the portion of a primitive that is projected onto a specific pixel. Actually, we can split pixels into sub-elements, called **samples**, and the fragment is associated to a sample. The value of a pixel is computed by averaging its associated samples.

This mechanism is called **multi-sampling** and is used for **anti-aliasing**, but we'll leave it off for now by setting the number of sample per pixel to 1.

```{lit} C++, Describe multi-sampling state (also for tangle root "Vanilla")
// Samples per pixel
pipelineDesc.multisample.count = 1;
// Default value for the mask, meaning "all bits on"
pipelineDesc.multisample.mask = ~0u;
// Default value as well (irrelevant for count = 1 anyways)
pipelineDesc.multisample.alphaToCoverageEnabled = false;
```

Okay, we finally **configured all the stages** of the render pipeline. All that remains now is to specify the behavior of the two **programmable stages**, namely give a **vertex** and a **fragment shaders**.

Shaders
-------

Both the vertex and fragment programmable stages use the same **shader module**, that we must first create. This module is kind of a dynamic library (like a .dll, .so or .dylib file), except that it talks the **binary language of your GPU** rather than your CPU's.

Like any compiled program, the shader is first written in a **human-writable programming language**, then **compiled** into low-level machine code. However, the low-level code is highly hardware-dependent, and often not publicly documented. So the application is distributed with the **source code** of the shaders, which is **compiled on the fly** when initializing the application.

### Shader code

The shader language officially used by WebGPU is called [WGSL](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/wgsl/), namely the *WebGPU Shading Language*. Any implementation of WebGPU must support it, and the JavaScript version of the API only supports WGSL, but the native header `webgpu.h` also offers the possibility to provide shaders written in [SPIR-V](https://www.khronos.org/spir) or [GLSL](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Core_Language_(GLSL)) (`wgpu-native` only).

```{tip}
**SPIR-V** is more of an intermediate representation, i.e., a **bytecode**, than something that one would write manually. It is the shader language used by the Vulkan API and a lot of tools exist to **cross-compile** code from other common shader languages (HLSL, GLSL) so it is an interesting choice when one needs to reuse **existing shader code bases**.
```

```{note}
Also note that WGSL was originally designed to be a human-editable version of SPIR-V programming model, so **transpilation** from SPIR-V to WGSL is in theory efficient and lossless (use [Naga](https://github.com/gfx-rs/naga) or [Tint](https://dawn.googlesource.com/tint) for this).
```

In this guide, we will only use WGSL. Its syntax may seem a bit unfamiliar if you are used to C/C++ so let us start with a very simple function and its equivalent in C++:

```rust
// In WGSL
fn my_addition(x: f32, y: f32) -> f32 {
	let z = x + y;
	return z;
}
```

```C++
// In C++
float my_addition(float x, float y) {
	auto z = x + y;
	return z;
}
```

Notice how the **types** are specified **after** instead of **before** the argument names. The type of `z` is automatically inferred, though we could have forced it using `let z: f32 = ...`. The return type is specified after the arguments, using the arrow `->`.

```{note}
The keyword `let` defines a constant, i.e., a variable that cannot be reassigned. A regular variable is defined using the `var` keyword.
```

Now here is the shader for our triangle:

```{lit} rust, The WGSL shader source code (also for tangle root "Vanilla")
@vertex
fn vs_main(@builtin(vertex_index) in_vertex_index: u32) -> @builtin(position) vec4f {
	var p = vec2f(0.0, 0.0);
	if (in_vertex_index == 0u) {
		p = vec2f(-0.5, -0.5);
	} else if (in_vertex_index == 1u) {
		p = vec2f(0.5, -0.5);
	} else {
		p = vec2f(0.0, 0.5);
	}
	return vec4f(p, 0.0, 1.0);
}

@fragment
fn fs_main() -> @location(0) vec4f {
	return vec4f(0.0, 0.4, 1.0, 1.0);
}
```

The function names `vs_main` (resp. `fs_main`) must have the very same name as what was specified as `entryPoint` in the vertex (resp. fragment) state.

```{note}
Shader languages natively support **vector and matrix types** up to size 4. The type `vec2f` is a vector of 2 floats, and an **alias** for the *templated* type `vec2<f32>`. As another example, the type `vec4<u32>` is a vector of 4 unsigned integers and has alias `vec4u`.
```

Tokens that start with an `@` are called **attributes** and decorate the object that comes afterward with various information. For instance, `@builtin(vertex_index)` tells that the argument `in_vertex_index` will be populated by the **built-in** input vertex attribute that is the **vertex index**. Note that the argument `in_vertex_index` could have had any other name: as long as it is decorated with the same built-in attribute, it has the same **semantics**.

We use this vertex index to set the output value of the shader. This output is labelled with the `@builtin(position)` attribute to mean that it must be **interpreted by the rasterizer** as the vertex position.

For more flexibility, the shader code should be loaded from a file, but for now we simply store it in a multi-line string literal in our `main.cpp`:

```{lit} C++, Shader source literal (also for tangle root "Vanilla")
const char* shaderSource = R"(
{{The WGSL shader source code}}
)";
```

```{lit} C++, file: main.cpp (replace, hidden, also for tangle root "Vanilla")
{{Includes}}
{{Global declarations}}
{{Application class}}
{{Main function}}
{{Application implementation}}
```

```{lit} C++, Global declarations (hidden, also for tangle root "Vanilla")
{{Shader source literal}}
```

### Creation of a shader module

The creation of the shader module starts as usual:

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Create Shader Module
ShaderModuleDescriptor shaderDesc;
{{Describe shader module}}
ShaderModule shaderModule = device.createShaderModule(shaderDesc);
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Create Shader Module (for tangle root "Vanilla")
WGPUShaderModuleDescriptor shaderDesc{};
{{Describe shader module}}
WGPUShaderModule shaderModule = wgpuDeviceCreateShaderModule(device, &shaderDesc);
```
````

At first glance, this descriptor seems to have only an array of compilation "hints" to fill, which we leave empty (and even nothing at all when using Dawn):

```{lit} C++, Describe shader module (also for tangle root "Vanilla")
#ifdef WEBGPU_BACKEND_WGPU
shaderDesc.hintCount = 0;
shaderDesc.hints = nullptr;
#endif
```

But this time, we do **not** set `nextInChain` to `nullptr`!

The `nextInChain` pointer is the entry point of WebGPU's **extension mechanism**. It is either null, or pointing to a structure of type `WGPUChainedStruct`. This structure is very simple. First it may recursively have a `next` element (again, either null or pointing to some `WGPUChainedStruct`). Second, it has a **struct type** `sType`, which is an enum telling in which struct the chain element can be cast. Each struct whose definition starts with a field `WGPUChainedStruct chain` has an associated SType.

To create a shader module from WGSL code, we use the `ShaderModuleWGSLDescriptor` SType. A SPIR-V shader can similarly be created using the `WGPUShaderModuleSPIRVDescriptor`.

The field `shaderCodeDesc.chain` corresponds to the chained struct when cast as a simple `WGPUChainedStruct`, which must be set to the corresponding SType enum value:

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Describe shader module (append)
ShaderModuleWGSLDescriptor shaderCodeDesc;
// Set the chained struct's header
shaderCodeDesc.chain.next = nullptr;
shaderCodeDesc.chain.sType = SType::ShaderModuleWGSLDescriptor;
// Connect the chain
shaderDesc.nextInChain = &shaderCodeDesc.chain;
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Describe shader module (append, for tangle root "Vanilla")
WGPUShaderModuleWGSLDescriptor shaderCodeDesc{};
// Set the chained struct's header
shaderCodeDesc.chain.next = nullptr;
shaderCodeDesc.chain.sType = WGPUSType_ShaderModuleWGSLDescriptor;
// Connect the chain
shaderDesc.nextInChain = &shaderCodeDesc.chain;
```
````

Finally we can setup the actual payload of the shader code descriptor:

```{lit} C++, Describe shader module (append, also for tangle root "Vanilla")
shaderCodeDesc.code = shaderSource;
```

```{admonition} Dawn
The Dawn implementation of WebGPU does not include the `hints`/`hintCount` in the shader module descriptor.
```

### Pipeline layout

One last thing before we can run our code: the shaders might need to **access input and output resources** (buffers and/or textures). These resources are made available to the pipeline by configuring a memory **layout**. Our first example does not use any resource:

```{lit} C++, Describe pipeline layout (also for tangle root "Vanilla")
pipelineDesc.layout = nullptr;
```

```{note}
Actually, setting the pipeline layout to `nullptr` does not mean that there is no input/output resources. It rather asks the backend to **figure out the layout** by itself by inspecting the shader (which in this very case is equivalent).
```

Wrapping up
-----------

We can now connect the dots! I suggest we initialize our render pipeline in a **dedicated method**:

```{lit} C++, Application implementation (hidden, append, also for tangle root "Vanilla")
{{InitializePipeline method}}
```

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, InitializePipeline method
void Application::InitializePipeline() {
	{{Create Shader Module}}
	{{Create Render Pipeline}}

	// We no longer need to access the shader module
	shaderModule.release();
}
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, InitializePipeline method (for tangle root "Vanilla")
void Application::InitializePipeline() {
	{{Create Shader Module}}
	{{Create Render Pipeline}}

	// We no longer need to access the shader module
	wgpuShaderModuleRelease(shaderModule);
}
```
````

As a consequence, we **move the declaration** of `pipeline` to the **class attributes**. We also do the same for the `surfaceFormat`, that was defined during the surface configuration:

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Application attributes (append)
// In Application class
private:
	RenderPipeline pipeline;
	TextureFormat surfaceFormat = TextureFormat::Undefined;
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Application attributes (append, for tangle root "Vanilla")
// In Application class
private:
	WGPURenderPipeline pipeline;
	WGPUTextureFormat surfaceFormat = WGPUTextureFormat_Undefined;
```
````

````{warning}
Make sure not to locally **shadow** the class-level declaration of `pipeline` and `surfaceFormat` by re-declaring them when calling `createRenderPipeline` and `getPreferredFormat` respectively.

```{lit} C++, Create Render Pipeline (hidden, replace)
RenderPipelineDescriptor pipelineDesc;
{{Describe render pipeline}}
pipeline = device.createRenderPipeline(pipelineDesc);
```

```{lit} C++, Create Render Pipeline (hidden, replace, for tangle root "Vanilla")
WGPURenderPipelineDescriptor pipelineDesc{};
pipelineDesc.nextInChain = nullptr;
{{Describe render pipeline}}
pipeline = wgpuDeviceCreateRenderPipeline(device, &pipelineDesc);
```

```{lit} C++, Describe Surface Format (hidden, replace)
surfaceFormat = surface.getPreferredFormat(adapter);
config.format = surfaceFormat;
// And we do not need any particular view format:
config.viewFormatCount = 0;
config.viewFormats = nullptr;
```

```{lit} C++, Describe Surface Format (hidden, replace, for tangle root "Vanilla")
surfaceFormat = wgpuSurfaceGetPreferredFormat(surface, adapter);
config.format = surfaceFormat;
// And we do not need any particular view format:
config.viewFormatCount = 0;
config.viewFormats = nullptr;
```
````

We also declare our initialization method in the Application declaration:

```{lit} C++, Private methods (append, also for tangle root "Vanilla")
// In Application class
private:
	void InitializePipeline();
```

We call it at the end of the `Initialize()` method:

```{lit} C++, Initialize (append, also for tangle root "Vanilla")
// At the end of Initialize()
InitializePipeline();
```

And **reciprocally** we release the pipeline at the beginning of the `Terminate()` method:

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Terminate (prepend)
// At the beginning of Terminate()
pipeline.release();
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Terminate (prepend, for tangle root "Vanilla")
// At the beginning of Terminate()
wgpuRenderPipelineRelease(pipeline);
```
````

Finally, we insert in the main loop the two lines that this chapter started with, just after creating the `renderPass` object:

````{tab} With webgpu.hpp
```{lit} C++, Draw a triangle (replace)
// Select which render pipeline to use
renderPass.setPipeline(pipeline);
// Draw 1 instance of a 3-vertices shape
renderPass.draw(3, 1, 0, 0);
```
````

````{tab} Vanilla webgpu.h
```{lit} C++, Draw a triangle (replace, for tangle root "Vanilla")
// Select which render pipeline to use
wgpuRenderPassEncoderSetPipeline(renderPass, pipeline);
// Draw 1 instance of a 3-vertices shape
wgpuRenderPassEncoderDraw(renderPass, 3, 1, 0, 0);
```
````

```{lit} C++, Use Render Pass (hidden, replace, also for tangle root "Vanilla")
{{Draw a triangle}}
```

And tadaam! You should finally see **a triangle**!

```{figure} /images/hello-triangle.png
:align: center
:class: with-shadow
Our first triangle rendered using WebGPU.
```

```{admonition} Dawn
When using Dawn, you may see **different colors** (more saturated), because the target surface use a **different color space**. More on this [later on](input-geometry/loading-from-file.md#color-issue).
```

Conclusion
----------

This chapter introduced the **core skeleton** for rendering triangle-based shapes on the GPU. For now these are 2D graphics, but once everything will be in place, switching to 3D will be straightforward. We have seen two very important concepts:

 - The **render pipeline**, which is based on the way the hardware actually works, with some parts fixed, for the sake of efficiency, and some parts are programmable.
 - The **shaders**, which are the GPU-side programs driving the programmable stages of the pipeline.

### What's next?

The key algorithms and techniques of computer graphics used for 3D rendering are for a large part implemented in the shaders code. What we still miss at this point though is ways to **communicate** between the C++ code (CPU) and the shaders (GPU).

The next two chapters focus on two ways to **feed input** to this render pipeline: **vertex** attributes, where there is one value per vertex, and **uniforms**, which define variable that are common to all vertices and fragments for a given call.

We then take a break away from pipeline things with the switch to **3D meshes**, which is in the end less about code and more about math. We also introduce a bit of **interaction** with a basic **camera controller**. We then introduce a 3rd way to provide input resource, namely **textures**, and how to map them onto meshes.

Storage textures, which are used the other way around, to get data out of the render pipeline, will be presented only in advanced chapters. Instead, the last chapter of this section is fully dedicated to the computer graphics matter of **lighting** and **material modeling**.
